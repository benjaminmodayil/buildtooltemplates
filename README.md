# NEWSME

Search for news on any topic.

## About

Newsme is a feed of relevant news for the day or surrounding a specific topic of interest using [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). You can also save an article to localstorage for future reading. It's built using ES6's Fetch API, SCSS, CSS Grid, and a multitude of things via Gulp's pipeline. Also designed with Sketch.

### The Idea

The idea came from looking for an interesting project to create using some sort of API. After coming across [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and realizing that it hasn't been used as much as other APIs, I decided to take a stab at creating something small with it.

Newsme lets you search for news, apply a category, set a date range, and even save articles locally to the browser's memory. After applying one of those inputs, just watch the news articles flow in. The purpose of the project is to help users stay informed about the news, not from one source, but a multitude.
